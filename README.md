### Hi I am Johnny, a software engineer.👋

### I just graduated from App Academy, and I have experience coding in Javascript and Python.  I have 4 full stack projects that I have worked on utilizing either a Javascript / Express back-end and a React / Redux front-end, or a Python / Flask back-end and a React / Redux front end.  I have worked mainly with a PostgreSQL database.  I know how to speak in 4 languages, and how to code in two languages so far 😁.  I am open to learning more languages.
